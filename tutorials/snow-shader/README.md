# Godot Snow Shader Tutorial
Well... there isn't actually tutorial to go with it (yet?), but you can enjoy the files. One folder is basically an empty skeleton, the other is a complete example project of a snow shader.

Textures are from [ambientcg.com](https://ambientcg.com/). The art isn't the best, it is for demonstrative purposes for the shader.
