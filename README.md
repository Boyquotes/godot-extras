# godot-extras
## NOTE: The main branch is a WIP of porting to Godot 4! Up-to-date and functional projects are on the 3.x at this time!
## Undergoing some restructuring right now!
My collection of various plugins, modules, or patches for Godot.

Mostly optimization and shaders.

Everything is licensed under MIT.

## [LOD in C++](https://github.com/puchik/godot-extras/tree/master/gdnative/multi-lod)
A LOD system that can be applied directly to any Spatial. There are also more specialized variants for Lights, GIProbes, and MultiMeshInstances.

## [Terrain/Vertex colour mixing shader](https://github.com/puchik/godot-extras/tree/master/visual/terrain-vertex-shader)
A shader that was originally intended for terrains, but can be applied to any mesh to add material mixing, detail, and more.

## [Snow shader](https://github.com/puchik/godot-extras/tree/master/tutorials/snow-shader)
This was supposed to be for a tutorial video, but I kept never getting to it. I decided to, at least, release the tutorial files (including the full shader).
